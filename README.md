# climateactionQuiz-oop-project
This is a group OOP project focused on SDG 13 (Climate Action)targeting climate change awareness. My contribution was developing interactive quizzes to educate users on climate issues. The app uses OOP principles .


## Project Overview
This project is part of a group assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course, focused on supporting Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13) - Climate Action. Our team developed an interactive application aimed at raising awareness about climate change through education and engagement.

## My Contribution: Quiz Feature
I was responsible for designing and implementing the **Quiz Feature** within the application. This feature helps users test their knowledge about climate change, sustainability, and environmental protection through fun and educational quizzes.

### Key Highlights:
- Developed multiple-choice quizzes related to climate change topics.
- Implemented user interaction to provide immediate feedback on answers.
- Used Object-Oriented Programming principles such as classes, methods, and encapsulation to build a scalable and maintainable quiz module.
- Integrated quizzes as part of the app’s educational tools to improve user engagement and learning.

## Technologies Used
- Java programming language
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts (Classes, Methods, Inheritance, Encapsulation)

## How to Use
The quiz feature allows users to answer questions, receive instant feedback, and track their progress. It supports both Admin and Public users, with Admins able to add or modify quiz questions.
